title: BubbleStart
---
<<set $time to 0>>
You take a break from work and go to the company's building roof to have the plain sandwich you prepared in a rush on the morning.
Exhaustedly, you sit on a bench and see a bubble wand.
The bubble wand looks almost empty, but enough for maybe one bubble

-> Blow bubble
    <<jump Blow>>
-> Finish your sandwich and go
    <<jump Leave>>
-> Stare stupidly at the bubble wand
    <<set $time to 1>>
    <<jump Staring>>

title: Staring
---
You stare at the bubble wand.
Almost like not a single thought is crossing your mind.
Like you're waiting for someone to choose an option for you...
-> Blow bubble
    <<jump Blow>>
-> Finish your sandwich and leave
    <<jump Leave>>
-> Keep staring
    You keep innocently staring at the bubble going up.
    Suddenly the clouds move and the sun starts shining strongly.
    You lose vision for a couple of seconds.
    You drop your sandwich and make a mess.
    As you try to clean the mess you realize your break finished 5 minutes ago
    You rush back to your office hungry and stressed.
    You think about the bubble you did and wonder where did it go...
    -USE SUNGLASSES ENDING-

title: Blow
---
You use the bubble wand.
A mid-sized bubble pops out.
You look at your bubble like a proud father watching his son on his first sports game...
<<if $time < 2>>
    -> Follow the bubble to the edge of the building.
        Your curiosity wins over you.
        You follow the bubble as it goes away to the edge of the building and get at an arms distance from it.
        -> Pop it
            For a moment, you feel powerful.
            You think to yourself: "I've got the power to create thus I also have the power to destroy"
            You get closer
            You pop the bubble.
            The poor bubble is no more.
            The feeling goes away, there is no more bubbles and your sandwich is cold now.
            You go back to work...
            -GOD MODE ENDING-
        -> Let it go
            <<jump LettingGo>>
    -> Relax and watch as the bubble fade away.
        You stay sit as you watch your creation float away.
        The wind carries the bubble up to the sky, where it disappears into a gap as the sun peeks through the gray clouds.
        Even though it's only a bubble, you feel an empowering feeling inside.
        You get up and decide to quit your boring job.
        You throw your cold, plain sandwich at your boss, go home, pack your suitcase, and venture off to sunnier lands and tropical beaches.
        -TROPICAL ESCAPE ENDING-
<<else>>
    The bubble floats away and you stare at it amusingly.
    Suddenly you feel a presence diving quickly at you from above.
    A seagull just stole your sandwich 🐦
        -> Follow the gull
        You hastily follow the seagull to try to get back your exquisite meal
        It's too fast!
            ->Throw something at it
                An ancestral hunter feeling flows within you and you decide to athletically throw something at the foul beast that just stole your carb-rich prey.
                The only thing within reach is your bag.
                You don't think too much about it.
                As the bag flies towards it's target you realize that you brought your working laptop in the bag to your lunch break. (Why?)
                The missile does not reach its feathered target.
                Your laptop gets destroyed.
                You go back to work with what's left of the company's laptop.
                You get fired.
                You start a small street food cart business selling bubble tea in the city
                It's not too bad!
                -BOBBA TEA ENDING-
            -> Give up
                It's been years since you stepped on a gym so your heroic pursuit comes to an end pretty fast.
                You go back to work with your head down after being defeated by a bird.
                You decide to join the gym the day after.
                -ATHLETIC ENDING-
        -> Stare at the bird dumbfounded
            The seagull succesfully flies towards the horizon making its seagull sounds.
            Almost like its laughing at you.
            You curse the bird as if it understands your language and get back to work.
            You decide you will buy some fried chicken afterwork so it's not all bad.
            -AVIAN ENDING-

title: Leave
---
You think to yourself: "Bubbles are for kids anyway, I'm a grown man"
You prepare to leave but you feel something holding you back and drawing you to the bubble making device
-> Use the bubble wand
    You have second thoughts and decide to use the bubble wand.
    Maybe there's the still some joy exisiting within you.
    <<set $time to 2>>
    <<jump Blow>>
-> Finish your food and go
    As a grown man should, you finish your sandwich and get ready to go back to work to get yelled at by your boss.
    You finish work and go back home to repeat it all again.
    -SALARY MAN ENDING-

title: Run

Well, looks like your break is over.
You go back to work and forget about it.
You hear some drama happening in the office, but you go on with your tasks and wait for the day to finish...
-NOTHING HAPPENED HERE ENDING-

You keep following it until it reaches the edge and slowly go down to the busy streets.
        You keep watching as your bubbly offspring floats down to the city.
        You can barely see it but it looks like its going to end up close to your building just in the front street.
        Looks like your creation it's going to meet its end at a seemingly desperate man's face.
        Unfortunately for that joker, bubbly pops right in his eye.
        The man throws his suitcase to the road in a fit of rage.
        -> Turn around and dissapear
            <<jump Run>>
        -> Keep watching
            Amused at the grown man throwing a tantrum over a bubble in the middle of the street, you keep watching.
            Suddenly you hear a tire screech and crash.
            The suitcase thrown by anti-bubble man hit a seemingly familiar car.
            It's your boss's car!
            The car hits another car parked in front of the company.
            That last car looked expensive...
            // Add options
            You run back to the office and wait for your boss to turn up to the office a bit more grumpy than he usually is.
            Suddenly you hear lots of yelling.
            Your boss is getting fired, looks like the car he hit was from the company owner.
            -> Take courage
                You think to yourself: "If a bubble did all this then I can do something big too"
                You step up and take charge of your now ex-boss's tasks
                You get promoted
                Eventually you become the new CEO
                You change the direaction of the company to a bubble making business and rename it BUBBLE INC
                Wow
                -BIG BOSS ENDING-
            -> Mind your business
                You mind your own business and keep staring at your laptop
                Eventually you get a new boss that yells at you a bit less than the previous one.
                Sometimes he buys pizza for everyone.
                Congrats?
                -DID SOMETHING REALLY CHANGE? ENDING-
